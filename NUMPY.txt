NUMPY: NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays(arrays: Arrays are used to store multiple values in one single variable)


Why do we use Numpy?
In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.

NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.

The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.

importing numpy:

  ---> import numpy as np

Numpys creating arrays:
Create a NumPy ndarray Object:

NumPy is used to work with arrays. The array object in NumPy is called ndarray.
We can create a NumPy ndarray object by using the array() function.

---->import numpy as np
     arr = np.array([1,2,4,5])
     print(arr)
     print(type(arr))--->< type of the object passed to it>

     o/p:[12345]                         
         <class'numpy.ndarray'>
----->To create an ndarray, we can pass a list, tuple or any array-like object into the array() method, and it will be converted into an ndarray

Dimensions in Arrays:
A dimension in arrays is one level of array depth (nested arrays)(nested arrays:are arrays that have arrays as their elements)
0-D Arrays:
hello hiiii
hello world
